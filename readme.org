This document is a collection of best practices and common pitfalls that I've encountered over many years of writing and editing scientific publications.

The manuscripts that we publish should use the same "house writing style" to maintain consistency and readability. In addition, this document describes the tools and workflows that I've refined over the years for smooth scientific authoring.

Please use this as a checklist to hone your own writing. Get in the habit of identifying and fixing these common pitfalls during your writing practice to become a more efficient writer.

* Overview
TODO: Write a section on how this document is organized.

* Authoring in LaTeX
** Why I like writing in LaTeX
1. Professional typesetting: LaTeX produces high-quality typesetting and formatting, making your document look more professional and polished. It provides consistent formatting and layout for the entire document, including headings, equations, tables, and references.

2. Math and scientific equations: LaTeX excels in handling mathematical and scientific equations. It has built-in support for mathematical symbols, formulas, and equations that are commonly used in academic writing. 

3. Version control: LaTeX documents are plain text files, which makes them well-suited for version control systems like Git (and Overleaf). Multiple authors can collaborate and track changes without all the nonsense of versioning via filenames (i.e., Manuscript-FINAL-FINAL-v2.1.docx). Git makes it easy to revert to previous versions or merge conflicting edits.

4. Cross-referencing: LaTeX allows you to reference sections, figures, tables, and equations easily and automatically. This is particularly useful when writing long documents, such as manuscripts, grants, and theses.

5. Work in your favorite text editor: I prefer to write in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs.]] You may prefer [[https://neovim.io/][Neovim]], VS Code (ðŸ’©), [[https://www.overleaf.com][Overleaf]], or something else entirely. With LaTeX, we can all work in our preferred editors where we've (hopefully) learned to be efficient.

6. Most importantly, writing in LaTeX separates /formatting/ from content-generation. By writing in plain-text, we can focus on the /substance/ of our writing and not the /formatting./ In comparison, just note how much time you spend formatting fonts, margins, and other nonsense in MS Word.

* Conventions
** Units
*** Writing units
- Include a space between a digit and its unit:
#+begin_quote
+0.5mM IPTG+ should be =0.5 mM IPTG=
#+end_quote
- Use appropriate Greek characters for units:
#+begin_quote
+5 ul+ should be =5 Î¼l=
#+end_quote
- Consistently write units that are per unit time or volume. Do not switch styles, as per the example below. I weakly prefer superscripts in the example below.
#+begin_quote
The buffer flow rate was 100 Âµl/min for all washing steps.
/or/
The buffer flow rate was 100 Âµl min^-1 for all washing steps.
#+end_quote
- Be consistent about how you report time units in figure axes and methods sections. Decide ahead of time if you're using ~hours, min, sec~ or ~hr, m, s~. I prefer the first, as its a bit more descriptive.
*** TODO Units in LaTeX

*** Optical density
#+begin_quote
+O.D. of 0.6-0.8+ should instead be OD_600~0.6-0.8
#+end_quote
*** Temperature
Report temperature in Celsius as follows. Note that there is a space between the digit and the degree symbol (Ëš). Include the degree symbol, it is not optional.
#+begin_quote
Cells were grown at 18 ËšC for 4 hours.
#+end_quote
*** Centrifugal units
Do not report centrifugal force in revolutions per minute (RPM). This unit reports how fast the centrifuge is spinning, but is meaningless without knowing the rotor type, angle of rotation, etc. Instead, report the relative centrifugal force (RCF), which refers to the force exerted directly on the sample. Most centrifuges will report the RCF when the rotor setting is set (or ifs a single rotor centrifuge).

** Genes & Proteins
- Gene names should be lowercase and italicized.
#+begin_quote
CRISPR-transposons do not encode the adaptation genes /cas1/ and /cas2/.
#+end_quote

- Human protein names tend to be ALLCAPS (e.g., DNA2), whereas yeast and other organisms are Upcase (e.g., Dna2).
- When discussing point mutants, define the mutation at least once using the following convention: NAME(from###to). For example: 
#+begin_quote
A helicase-deficient DNA2(K654R) mutant decreased resection processivity and velocity.
#+end_quote

Most importantly, keep the gene and their corresponding protein names separate. That is, do not confuse /cas1/ (the gene) and Cas1 (the protein) in your writing.
** Acronyms, abbreviations, and other common words
*** Organism names
Define organism names, especially when referring to enzymes that were sub-cloned from these organisms. Include at least one definition in the main text---introduction or results---and another in the methods section.

Here is an example from the methods section of a paper:
#+begin_quote
The gene expressing /Eubacterium siraeum/ Cas13d (/Es/ Cas13d)  was synthesized (IDT) and cloned into ... 
#+end_quote

*** Define common acronyms
| BS^3     | bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate       |
| cryo-EM | cryo-electron microscopy             |
| CVs     | column volumes                       |
| DAP     | diaminopimelic acid                  |
| IPTG    | isopropyl Î²-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside |
| LB      | lysogeny broth                       |
| MBP     | maltose binding protein              |

#+begin_notes
Note to self: Use C-c ^ to sort the org-table
#+end_notes
*** Common words
We commonly use the following words in our writing. Please stick with these conventions:
| *Correct usage* | *Incorrect*            |
| flowcell      | flow cell; flow-cell |
** Reporting code and other content via GitHub
Code and some supplemental resources are shared via the [[https://github.com/orgs/finkelsteinlab/][Finkelstein Lab GitHub]] page.

To add to our repository:
1. Create your own GitHub account.
2. Create a *private* repository that will summarize the project. Do not make the repo public unless we're ready to release the manuscript.
3. *Include a descriptive readme.md file.* The file should describe the main goals of the project, what each module does, and how to cite the resulting manuscript. If the manuscript isn't online yet, include a placeholder or link to bioRxiv.
4. Let me know when we're ready to make the repository visible. I will fork it to our official GitHub mirror.
** Genomic datasets
The [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/overview.html][gene expression omnibus]] (GEO) is an international public repository that archives and freely distributes microarray, next-generation sequencing, and other forms of high-throughput functional genomics data submitted by the research community.

- If your manuscript is re-analyzing prior published date, double check whether its been submitted to GEO. Include GEO accession numbers in a supplemental table.
- If your manuscript includes new sequencing data that falls within the GEO mandate, upload it to GEO and report the accession numbers in your manuscript.
* Figures
** Software and Templates
The lab is transitioning to the free, cross-platform [[https://inkscape.org/][Inkscape]] as a drop-in replacement for [[https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html][Adobe Illustrator]].

Inkscape has nearly the same functionality, exports standard SVG files, and a robust bookmarking system. 

As a bonus, Inkscape has a convenient [[https://inkscape.org/doc/inkscape-man.html][command line interface]] for adjusting graphic sizes and formats. 

For example, the code below will export an svg figure into a png with a white background:
#+begin_src
  inkscape -b FFFFFF -h 1024 -d 300 input.svg -o output.png
#+end_src
#+begin_notes
TODO: I need to test the CLI at some point
#+end_notes
You can use the template below to start designing your figure. It also includes guides for various figure widths, ranging from a single- to 1.5- and two-column formats.

** Figure design
Below are a few pointers on designing clean and consistent figures:

- Keep figure axes and legends consistent
- 

** Using color in plots and figures
This is a vast topic that cannot be fully explored within the scope of this document. For a concise treatment, please read the following key sections of [[https://clauswilke.com/][Claus Wilke's]] excellent book, [[https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/][Fundamentals of Data Visualization]].

* Citations
Papers that are authored in LaTeX use BibLaTeX for providing citations. BibLaTex is a modern, mature, and highly capable software package. 
** Tutorials on BibLaTeX
- [[https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_with_biblatex][Bibliography management with biblatex - Overleaf]]: This is an excellent tutorial that covers the basics of working with BibLaTeX files. I highly recommend this tutorial.

** Convert and tidy up citations
- [[https://www.doi2bib.org/][doi2bib]]: generate =BibTex= citations from the Digital Object Identifier (DOI)
- [[https://rintze.zelle.me/ref-extractor/][Reference Extractor]]: upload a =DOCX= or =ODT= document and export the citations as a =BibTeX= file. If using Zotero, you can optionally mark all citations that occur in your Zotero libraries.
- [[://github.com/FlamingTempura/bibtex-tidy][bibtex-tidy]]: tidy up bib files by removing duplicates, un-needed fields, clean up whitespace, etc. Browser, CLI, and API tools:
