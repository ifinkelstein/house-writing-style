The manuscripts that we publish should use the same "house writing style" to maintain consistency and readability

This document is a collection of common pitfalls that I've encountered over many years of writing and editing scientific publications.

Please use this as a checklist to double check your own writing.

* Units
** Include a space between a digit and its unit:
#+begin_quote
+0.5mM IPTG+ should instead be =0.5 mM IPTG=
#+end_quote
** Optical density
Report OD units as follows:
#+begin_quote
+O.D. of 0.6-0.8+ should instead be OD_600~0.6-0.8
#+end_quote
** Temperature
Report temperature in Celsius as follows. Note that there is no space between the digit and the degree symbol (˚). Include the degree symbol, it is not optional.
#+begin_quote
Cells were grown at 18˚C for 4 hours.
#+end_quote
* Acronyms and abbreviations
** Common acronyms that need to be defined at least once
| IPTG | isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside |
|      |                                      |
